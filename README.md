## Installation
In order to install the project you will need to download all the files in this repository, put the files in to any directory you would like. Once you have extracted the files from the zip folder you will need to open a command line terminal in that upper most directory (this directory will contain the app.js file). In order to run this you will need to have Node.js installed. In the command line first type 'npm install' or just 'npm i'. After that You have installed the application! Easy right?

## Usage
To use the Team Profile Generator, after installation type 'node app.js' into your terminal. Then Follow the prompts on your screen. NOTE: what ever you enter into the terminal for each answer will be what displays on the website so make sure to use capital letters and check spelling errors when needed. Once you have gone through all the prompts navigate to the src/dev directory. Your html page and CSS will be waiting for you.
